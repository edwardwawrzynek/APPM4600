# APPM4600 Lab 2

Test repository for learning git for APPM4600. This repository contains copies of the code that was written in lab 1, as well as empty directories for homework and other lab excersizes. In particular, the directory structure looks like the following:

- `Homework`
- `Labs`
	- `Lab 1`

In the future, this directory could contain homework for the course or future labs. At the moment, it is largely empty.
